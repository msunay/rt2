## TECH STACK (How) (30 seconds)

**[Scene 4]**

- **Atai:** *(facing the camera)* “Behind the scenes, Real Time Trivia is 
powered by a robust tech stack. We’ve harnessed the power of Next.js with 
TypeScript, integrated JWT for authentication, and PostgreSQL for our 
database. And with WebRTC, we’re able to provide a seamless real-time 
experience for our users.”

## INSIGHTS (Lessons learned) (30 seconds)

**[Scene 5]**

- **Carlos or Alex:** “Building Real Time Trivia was a learning curve with 
which we navigated the complexities of real-time application design. Team 
collaboration was key, and with each challenge, our collective 
problem-solving grew stronger, shaping us into well-rounded developers.”

**Notes:** Atai will be filmed on screen as host, so there will be some 
images of him presenting each question, both on camera and on screen.
