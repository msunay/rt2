2. Set up the frontend by navigating to the frontend directory and running `npm install`.

```
cd rt2/client
npm install
```
3. Whilst in `/client` copy `.env.example` to a `.env.local` file and fill in variables (You can find your local by continuing through to step 10 to see the ip Metro is using when the expo server is running).

```
cd client
cp .env.example .env
```
4. Similarly, set up the backend by going to the backend directory and running `npm install`.

```
cd rt2/server
npm install
```

5. Create a PostgreSQL database for the application.
6. Whilst in `/server` copy `.env.example` to a `.env` file and fill in variables.

```
cd server
cp .env.example .env
```
7. Start the backend server using `npm run dev` in the backend directory.

```
cd rt2/server
npm run dev
```

8. Populate the database with mock data by running this command in the `/server` directory.

```
npm run populate
```
9. Download Expo Go on your device from either the Android Play Store or iOS App Store.
10. Start the frontend development server using `npx expo start` in the `/client` directory.

```
cd rt2/client
npx expo start
```

11. Scan the QR code with either the Expo Go app (on Android) or with your camera (on IOS) to open the app
